        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            Ambitious and enthusiastic student with a strong interest in neuroscience, seeking to pursue an undergraduate degree
            in Neuroscience to deepen my understanding of brain function, engage in cutting-edge research, and prepare for a
            future career with practical experience in the field.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Driven by a passion for neuroscience, I have excelled academically, achieving a remarkable weighted GPA of
            4.5+ and an unweighted GPA of 3.9+ through rigorous coursework including 11 AP and 13 Honors classes. My
            leadership roles as Vice-President of the National Honors Society and Fundraiser Chair for Habitat For Humanity
            have allowed me to hone my organizational and team-building skills. Co-founding "Moving for Memories" not
            only demonstrated my initiative and dedication to community service but also contributed to advancing dementia
            research. Recognized for my potential, I was selected as a Delegate for the Congress of Future Medical Leaders
            by Harvard University and earned certification as an Information Technology Specialist. My advanced proficiency
            in Java and Spanish, combined with my athletic participation in cross country and golf, reflect a well-rounded
            and committed work ethic to drive myself through the challenges of college.
